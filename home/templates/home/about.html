                I have been crafting since I was in primary school, taught by my two expert grannies to knit and
                crochet.
                I find working with my hands a source of comfort, relaxation and an opportunity to experiment with
                creativity.
                <br>
                <p>I had been making hats and blankets just for myself and family until friends started to request for
                    themselves. And so <span class="title-font">Knits and Pieces</span> was born.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the last couple of years the sewing machine also came out as pretty and comfortable cotton
                    facemasks were in demand.
                    Who would have thought we'd still be wearing them?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I hope you enjoy my creations!</p>
