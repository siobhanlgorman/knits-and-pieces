## UX Design
### Strategy
#### Agile Planning
User stories (Issues) with acceptance criteria and tasks are each linked to an Epic (Milestone) and placed in an Iteration kanban board (Projects 1, 2 and 3). Due to the project time constraints no dates are included. Each user story is labelled with a must-have should-have, could-have or won't have label to show prioritisation. See table [here](####user-stories)

#### Project Goal

The goal of the project is to create an online store for this developer's handmade items; primarily crocheted throws and blankets, knitted hats and cotton facemasks. This is a real-world application to create a store for this developer's products which have been custom-made and sold on a word-of-mouth basis over ten years. Buyers have encouraged the set-up of an online store to increase sales and customer base.

#### Target audience

- People who like colourful, handmade, good quality items. 
- People who like knitted and crocheted items.
- People who want to order custom made throws and blankets in colours of their choosing.
- People looking for unique gifts

* Business Goals

- To create a professional online store
- To provide an easy and secure means to purchase items.
- To increase the customer base
- To create a brand for the store and increase brand awareness
- To encourage subscriptions to the site newsletter

#### Customer Goals

- To view the products available
- To buy colourful, handmade items
- To navigate easily through the website
- To be able to pay securely for items
- To be confident that the site is genuine and trustworthy


#### User Stories

Using the Agile approach Epics (Github Milestones) were created and broken down into several User Stories (Github Issues). User Stories were fleshed out with Acceptance Criteria and Tasks assigned to each. Due to the time constraints and knowledge level of this developer it was not possible in every case to decide the tasks in advance of carrying out the work although this would be the ideal in a workplace environment. User Stories were sorted into four priority level with 1 as top priority and 4 as least prioritised. User Stories with Priority 1 were allocated a label of 'must-have', 2 as 'should-have', 3 as 'could-have'. These User Stories were divided into three Iterations (Github Projects). For the purposes of this project a timeframe was not assigned although in a real world environment it would be. Those User Stories allocated Priority 4 which would be 'won't have' were not placed in the table but are included in [Future Features](###future-features). Several stories marked as 'could-have' were not completed due to time constraints (#5, #7, #29 #30 )

#### SEO and Web Marketing
- SEO 
Research on short and long-tail keywords was conducted via google searches to find the search words and phrases thatm most related to a site like Knits and Pieces. Handmade was particularly crucial to a good search result when incorporated with the product categories and craft type. Keywords were incorporated into the meta tags and headings where appropriate while not overloading the site content and maintaining the usefulness of the site.
- Web Marketing
Paid web advertising is not currently within the scope of this project. However a newsletter link has been added to the website as an easy way for a small business such as Knits and Pieces to reach customers and keep them up to date with new products, special offers and to keep the ecommerce store fresh.
Newsletter
A Facebook business page was set up for the purposes of this project. This is another method for a small business to reach new customers and retain existing customers. The site is viewable whether or not a user has an account with Facebook. Since the business is not currently live this site may have been taken down. Screenshots are provided in case the link is no longer valid. [Link to Facebook business page](https://www.facebook.com/Knits-and-Pieces-111739761381732)

View of Facebook business page to site owner with Facebook account:

View of Facebook Business page to prospective customer without Facebook account:
![Facebook Business Page Customer's view](documentation/screenshots/fb-page2.png)

A future intention to increase the site's usefulness to customers is to add a craft blog to the site with links to videos on interesting stitches and patterns and links to othe interesting websites and YouTube videos. This would evoke a positive emotional response in customers and in turn build trust and loyalty to the business. It would also provide a means to keep the site up to date, relevant and fresh in customers' minds. 

### Scope
* Requirements
The approach taken was to create a minimum viable product which in this case was to create a functioning ecommerce store with the ability to view and purchase a product via a seamless payment facility (in this case Stripe).
The User Stories were prioritised as described [above](###user-stories) and shown in the table with functional requirements prioritised as 1
* Constraints
The time frame for this project was extremely short and broken up with Christmas holidays. In addition the time to learn and become familiar with the language and tools necessary to have a good understanding of the development process was short. As a result there are many improvements to be made in the future but a basic and funcioning ecommerce store has been created.


### Structure
#### Database
For this project the PostgresSql database was used from the outset. Since fixtures were not being used and the number of products was relatively small this meant the products could be added to the deployed database from the beginning and so saving some time.

#### Models

There are eight models in this project (excluding those which are automatically created by Django). Four models have been specifically customised for the purposes of this ecommerce store: Product, Tag, ContactForm and CustomOrderForm

- Products App Models
In the Products app there are three models: Product, Category and Tag. The Product model is specifically designed for this project with customised fields specific to handmade products. The tag model was developed to display special information relating to several products but not all. The Product model links to the Category and Tag model by a Foreign Key. The product model initially had two more image fields (highlighted as the intention was for a more detailed product template showing the product in different situations. However due to the time involved in creating and sizing professional photos it was decided not to include this feature in this initial version of the ecommerce store. These fields were then removed to keep the code clean. Also a likes field (highlighted was included initially to add to a function where the user would like a product and add to a wishlist. Again due to time constraints this was removed as a feature for this version of the store.

![Category Model](documentation/screenshots/category-model.png)
![Tag Model](documentation/screenshots/tag-model.png)

- Checkout App
In the Checkout app there are two models. The Order and OrderLineItem contain the information for the user to create a purchase order. The Order model links to the user profile model in the Profiles App by a foreign key. The OrderLineItem model refers to each specific product in the order and links to the Order and Products models by a foreign key.

![Order Model](documentation/screenshots/order-model.png)
![OrderLineItem Model](documentation/screenshots/lineitem-model.png)

- Profiles App
In the Profiles app there is a UserProfile model which uses the Django default User model.

![User Profile Model](documentation/screenshots/user-profile-model.png)

- Contact App
In the Contact App there is a custom ContactForm model for the customer to send a message to the Knits and Pieces store.

![Contact Form Model](documentation/screenshots/contact-form-model.png)

- Custom App
The Custom App has a specifically customised CustomOrder model for a customer to request a quote to have a particular product (Blanket) made to order in a choice of colours, sizes and patterns. It was originally intended to link this to the Product model but in as this was being added later in development it was not possible as some of the fields should have been separate models from the beginning and linked via foreign keys. Due to time constraints and lack of expertise in the planning stage this was not foreseen and could not have been undertaken in the later stages of the project.

### Surface

* Overall Design Choice
- The emphasis is to look professional and modern and to showcase the high quality artisan goods for sale. Research on websites selling similar handmade goods often have either a very traditional and amateur look or a very cluttered look. The site should look clean and elegant with a plain background to highlight the colorful products. Minimal colours used in keeping with the minimalist approach but making the site attractive to draw user's eye and tone with the products' colours. 

* Colours
- colours changed due to contrast issues
- created a logo from a bright coloured suare from a product
- created a palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/d20f35-e36477-3a445c-728668-bbb19d)
- Picked from sample product square, used for logo
- Crimson for Title font
- Charcoal - main font colour #3a3a3a
* Typography
- Cinzel for Titles - fancy, elegant, commanding
* Images
- The images used for the website were all taken and edited by this developer as the ecommerce products are all the developer's own. The approach was to create transparent backgrounds to highlight the products and their colours in isolation and against a plain white background. This was a learning experience and proved more time-consuming than anticipated. As a result some images could be improved given more time but are satisfactory for the purposes of this project. Paint 3D was used to remove the backgrounds, crop and resize the images. [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/upload) was also used where the size reduction did not compromise the quality.
